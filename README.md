## My process

### Built with

- React.js - JavaScript library
- Tailwind CSS - For styling
- TheMealDB API - For recipe data
- CSS Grid
- Vite - Build tool
- JavaScript ES6+ features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design



### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to work with external APIs and manage state in React. I learned how to handle form submissions and create reusable components.

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Adding more advanced search filters (by category, cuisine type)
- Implementing user authentication and saved recipes
- Learning more about error handling and loading states
- Improving accessibility features
- Adding unit tests for components




### Useful resources

- [TheMealDB API Documentation](https://www.themealdb.com/) - This helped me understand the API endpoints and data structure.
- [React Documentation](https://www.example.com) - Great for understanding hooks and component lifecycle.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Helpful for styling and responsive design patterns.
- [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/) - I watched several youtube videos that explaine layouts and syntax.
